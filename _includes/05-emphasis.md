I'm a *public health* student from Berlin at the end of the 2nd semester. Therefore, the study contains a lot of *epidemiology*, *biostatistics* and *public health* issues. In this context I was introduced in the **R** syntax and had 3 different courses covering this programming language. Due to my newly discovered fascination for programming languages I now want to learn more about the usage in accordance to larger data projects and therefore want to learn more about R and other programming languages, to get a larger view on the topic of **programming** and **data science**.
